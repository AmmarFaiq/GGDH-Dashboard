https://ggdh-dashboard.onrender.com 

This is one of the ongoing dashboard projects for GGDH-ELAN from the Department of Public Health and Primary Care at LUMC / Health Campus the Hague. In the current version, there are a few notes that we need to be aware of :

1. Area coverage (will increase in the future):

- ''s-Gravenhage
- Leidschendam-Voorburg
- Rijswijk
- Wassenaar
- Hadoks Area (all of the above Gementee)
 
2. Working pages are :

- Neighbourhood: contain infographics of current and past variables per Neighbourhood.
- Supply and Demand: contains clustering and projection of selected variables per Neighbourhood in Collaboration with Hadoks

3. Multiple pages still "work-in-progress" (Diabetes, Palliative care and Pedriatic care)
4. Language options are still a work in progress
5. Utility pages still work in progress (About Us, Variables Explanation, Data Availability, Changelog)

What we can do to improve :

1. Use parquet for faster and lighter data 

2. hack and slash: server separated for different function, data processing in other server, and visualization on the other

3. Use more standard web tools besides dash so it is more flexible in web visualization (maybe jquery).

4. Remove wijk number (end user is not needed)

5. Name of rijswijk Wijk : https://www.rijswijk.nl/de-wijken-van-rijswijk
