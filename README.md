1.Area coverage (will increase in the future):
  - ''s-Gravenhage
  - Leidschendam-Voorburg
  - Rijswijk
  - Wassenaar
  - Hadoks Area (all of the above gementee)
2. Working pages are :
   - Neighbourhood : contain infographics of current and past variables per Neighbourhood.
   - Supply and Demand : contains clustering and projection of selected variables per Neighbourhood in Collaboration with Hadoks
3. Multiple pages still "work-in-progress" (Diabetes, Palliative care and Pedriatic care)
4. Language options still work in progress
5. Utilities pages still work in progress (About Us, Variables Explnation, Data Availability, Changelog)
